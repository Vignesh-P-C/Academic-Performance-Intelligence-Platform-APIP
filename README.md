# 📘 Academic Performance Intelligence Platform (APIP)
**Version:** v1.0.0  

A browser-based **role-based academic analytics dashboard** built with **React 18, TypeScript, and Zustand**.  
The platform transforms static academic results into **actionable decision intelligence** for Students, Faculty, and HODs.

The system is designed incrementally with a strong focus on **clean architecture, deterministic analytics, real-time recomputation, and SaaS-grade UX polish**.

## 🎯 Core Product Philosophy:

This is **not** a marks viewer.

APIP is built to answer role-specific decision questions:

| Role      | Primary Question |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Student   | Where am I underperforming and how can I improve? |
| Faculty   | How is my subject performing across the class? |
| HOD       | Which subjects or faculty require intervention? |

All intelligence is computed **client-side** using a pure TypeScript analytics engine.
